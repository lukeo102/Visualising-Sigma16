to make memory monitoring
  monitor line of code
    pause execution when line reached
    code to memory location tranlation needed
      code line -> memory location -> monitor memory location
  monitor memory location
    pause execution when location accessed
    ability to update state on memory location access
      memory access returns enum instead of value (Success(Value), Monitored(Value), EditedSuccess, EditedMonitored(OldValue, NewValue))
      match on return enum
        can implement the same with registers
  monitor variable
    pause execution when variable accessed
    symbol table needed
      variable name -> memory location -> monitor memory location
